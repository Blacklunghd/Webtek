    <h1>The investigation</h1>
    <p>
    Only one ATC, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitaly_Kaloyev'>Peter Nielsen</a> of ACC Zurich, was controlling the airspace through which the aircraft were flying. The other controller on duty was resting in another room for the night. 
    This was against <a href='https://www.skyguide.ch/services/aeronautical-information-management' >Skyguide's regulations</a>, but had been a common practice for years and was known and tolerated by management. Maintenance work was being carried out on the main radar image processing system, 
    which meant that the controllers were forced to use a <a href='https://www.siatm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/brochure_fbs_201502.pdf'>Fallback systems</a>.</p>
     
    <p>
    The ground-based optical collision warning system, which would have alerted the controller to the pending collision about 21/2 minutes before it happened,had been switched off for maintenance. Nielsen was unaware of this.
    An aural short-term conflict alert warning system released a warning addressed to workstation RE SUED at 23:35:00 (32 seconds before the collision). </p>
    <p>
    This warning was not heard by anyone present at that time, although no error in this system could be found in a subsequent technical audit;however, whether or not this audible warning is functional is not something that is technically logged. 
    Even if Nielsen had heard this warning, at that time finding a useful resolution order by the ATC was impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
    All countries involved could add additional "deviating" statements to the official report. Bahrain, Switzerland, and Russia did submit positions that were published with the official report. 
    The deviating statements were published verbatim as an appendix to the report by the BFU investigators.
    </p>
<h1> Statements from the official report </h1>
    <p>
    The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Überlingen_mid-air_collision'>statement</a> by Bahrain, the home country of the DHL plane, mostly agrees with the findings of the report. It says that the report should have put less emphasis on the actions of individuals and more on the faults within Skyguide's organisation and management. 
    Bahrain's statement also mentions the lack of crew resource management in the Tupolev's cockpit as a factor in the crash.
    </p> 

    <p>
    Russia states that the Russian pilots were unable to obey the TCAS advisory to climb; the advisory was given when they were already at 10,800m (35,500ft), while the controller wrongly stated conflicting traffic was above them at 11,000m (36,000ft). 
    Also, the ATC gave the wrong position of the DHL plane (2 o'clock instead of the actual 10 o'clock). 
    Russia asserts that the DHL crew had a "real possibility" to avoid a collision, since they were able to hear the conversation between the Russian crew and the controller.
    </p>

    <p>
    Switzerland notes that the Tupolev was about 33m (108ft) below the flight level ordered by the Swiss controller, and still descending at 580m/min (1,900ft/min). 
    The Swiss say that this was also a cause of the accident. Switzerland also requested that the BFU make a formal finding that the TCAS advisories would have been useful if obeyed immediately; the BFU declined to do so.
